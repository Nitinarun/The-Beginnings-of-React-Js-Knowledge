# The-Beginnings-of-React-Js-Knowledge

With the ever growing age of technologies used to build code, systems, mobile app and web applications, keeping up to date with the industry and the technologies at the fore-front is super important in order to stay relevant
in a company or within the industry as a whole. As a brand new developer, I found out soon after graduating that the topics and modules learnt in university did not prepare me at all for the industry I was trying to enter, 
hence the need to spend all my remaining hours within a day to learn the most relevant frameworks. React.js was the framework I had chosen due to the popularity as well as scalablity of the framework. 

My first pushes to this repository hold the first of many coding tutorials I will be partaking to develop an understanding of how the framework functions while also freshening up on my existing knowledge of JavaScript. Within
this first push, I learnt about the basics of components, functions, importing and exporting components, structure of react.js as well as using states and props. The project I had built utilising this knowledge was a simple 
e-Commerce cart system whereby I could add & delete "items" from a cart.
